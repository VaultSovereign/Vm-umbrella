# ðŸœ„ START HERE â€” vm-umbrella (Law & Governance)

## What this is
The **constitutional layer** of VaultMesh: CI/CD policy, governance docs, codex pointers, and cryptographic proofs of release.

## How it fits
- **Upstream:** none (root of law)
- **Downstream:** vm-spawn (deploy), vm-codex (doctrine), vm-mesh (runtime)

## Quick commands
```bash
make seal        # hash governance corpus â†’ UMBRELLA_SEAL.json
make verify      # recompute & check seal
make anchor      # optional: RFC-3161 timestamp; push proof to artifacts
```
