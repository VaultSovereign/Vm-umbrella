# VaultMesh Blueprints — GTM / Legal

These GTM/legal docs live in the umbrella so business-facing collateral travels
with governance, compliance, and policy repositories. All engineering and technical
documents live in vm-forge, alongside the code they describe, to prevent drift and
keep implementation details versioned with their source.

This folder intentionally contains business-facing documents only:

- PRIVACY.md
- TOS.md
- SUPPORT.md
- FINTECH_PRICING.md
- SALES/

Technical & implementation documents now live in vm-forge:

- Repo: https://github.com/VaultSovereign/vm-forge
- Docs: https://github.com/VaultSovereign/vm-forge/tree/main/docs

Historical blueprint content imported from earlier repos has been archived.
See: ../archive/blueprints-vaultmesh-ai-import/

— Reduce duplication: keep GTM/legal here; evolve engineering docs in vm-forge with code.
